1. Focus on getting a working game in the console first. Make sure you include logic that checks for when the game is over! You should be checking for all winning 3-in-a-rows and ties. Try to avoid thinking about the DOM and your HTML/CSS until your game is working. Don’t worry about taking user input at this point either. You can call your functions and pass arguments to them to play the game yourself and check if everything is working as intended.

2. Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic. Write a function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage (for now, you can always just fill the gameboard array with "X"s and "O"s just to see what’s going on).

3. Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elements (e.g. letting players click on a board square to place their marker). Don’t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!

4. Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!



		----> refactor the prompt input so it accounts for the DOM

		----> we do have the rendercellcontents function that handles the DOM logic although I think making the logic separate from the dislpay function is good.
		----> the dom logic needs to be integrated with the board updating methods and modules.


		----> we'll need an iife for dom user input interaction. or maybe a factory function idk

		----> input fields for player names and option dropdown for choosing either 'x' or 'o'
		----> we do have a notification display element
		----> button to start a new game
		----> display element for results. We could use the notification display div for that but we could also make a new display div.



NOTES:

1. assignValue is breaking when a filled in cell is selected.

2. on executing playRound, the round number gets rendered, it would be nice if the game flow went like this in the final version

		start game --> add player names --> round 1 --> play round  --> round++ --> play round --> win / lose --> scoreboard --> play again

3. The winConChecker uses the round value for some reason in order to determine if it's a win / lose or a tie. So any functions fucking with it will produce anomalies. And if I make a function to account for the unintended increase in round count then that's just sloppy design. Lemme see what I can do about it. [fixed]

4. I think I should add some kind of buffer between starting a new game and starting a new round? as outlined above.

TO DO:

1. display the scores on the webpage.
2. win message display. [done]
3. make the round display div
4. make the start game button
5. make the play again button
6. add event listeners to the divs
7. make a function that takes user input to start a new game.
	-that function then asks the user for player1 and player2 names. [maybe add a randomiser ?] [this could be a modal]
	-after confirming the names, the round starts.
	-round display displays the round number.
	-player name is displayed in the notification div
	-user selects a cell which causes the round to move forward.

MODAL LOGIC: 
	- use the .showModal() method to display a modal dialog.
	- it can be closed using the .close() method or using the dialog method when submitting a <form> that is nested within the <dialog> element.
	- use ::backdrop to style the backdrop
